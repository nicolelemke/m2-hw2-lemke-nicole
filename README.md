## Issues
I didn't have any major issues with this assigment. I was wondering if there is a way to make the images fill the container without distorted them. I couldn't figure out how to do that. I also wasnt sure if we were allowed to use any external css.. I used a little bit but overall tried to utlize bootstrap the whole time.
